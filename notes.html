	Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Idea for this kind of software came along from my interest in Formula 1 and also idea to expand my knowledge and build something on my own using MATLAB software. Im a studnet of Warsaw University of Technology studying Aerospace Engineering. My passion to Formula 1 came from interest in technical aspect of the sport how by small adjustments and tweeks cars can be quicker then their opponents.
